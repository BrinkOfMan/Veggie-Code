# Veggie-Code
A web-based project management tool developed to keep users within VSCode and organized.

This package contains both the Veggie Code Snippets extension, and the Better Comments formatting extension published by Aaron Bond

The snippets extensoin introduces a variety of snippets to allow for quicker formatting of project management and code organization.

Snippets prefixes all contain "!v" and will work by hitting the "Tab" key after choosing which prefix to use.

Happy managing!
