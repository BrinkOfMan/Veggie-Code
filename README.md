# Veggie-Code
A project management tool developed to keep users within VSCode and organized.

[GitHub](https://github.com/BrinkOfMan/Veggie-Code)

## Description
This package contains the Veggie Code Snippets extension, as well as the Better Comments formatting extension published by Aaron Bond.

The snippets extension introduces a variety of snippets to allow for quicker formatting of project management text and code organization.

The formatting extension provides distinct text colors to distinguish between what type of documentation is being written.

## Usage
