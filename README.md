# Veggie-Code
A project management tool developed to keep users within VSCode and organized.

This package contains the Veggie Code Snippets extension, as well as the Better Comments formatting extension published by Aaron Bond.

The snippets extension introduces a variety of snippets to allow for quicker formatting of project management text and code organization.

Snippet prefixes all contain "!v" and will work by hitting the "Tab" key after choosing which prefix to use.

To get started, use "!veggiecode" to see all possible snippets and their descriptions.

To see sample files for both in-document and workflow styles of extension use, visit the "testing" folder located within the "Veggie-Code-Snippets" folder.

Happy managing!
